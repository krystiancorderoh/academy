The purpose of this exercise is to reinforce the best practices that we must use in software development.

You need to:
	- Learn and study what the hell the best practices mean
	- Study the best practices that we use in Java
	- Once you have the knowledge you need to:
		> Read the code
		> Understand what the code is doing
		> Re-factor the code
		> Complete the methods not developed

Plus:
